Ski Lift
CSCI 3308

Ski Lift will allow skiers and snowboarders to ask for/offer rides to/from other local
ski mountains. Drivers will have the option to offer rides for a moderate fee or for free. The
main purpose of the website is to create a cheaper ride service that allows skiers to get to
their favorite local resorts for less or no cost.

The website will also include some pages of basic, updated information, including
weather. This way, skiers will only need to go to one place
for all their skiing information and transportation needs.

The website will be marketed towards college students, who are likely to share rides with
their peers and also more likely to need or want cheap transportation to their favorite skiing
destinations. The app will focus on simplicity and useability, with just a few easy to use and
highly useful features.
