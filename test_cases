Test Plan:
	We will test the following cases multiple times by creating fake user profiles to act as users on the website. 
  The fake profiles will create and select rides as well as have unique profile information. This way we can test 
  out the information put into our database and our html forms. Unique values will also be tested as inputs into 
  the database to ensure no errors are created in the tables.
    
Test Cases:
1. Creating a user profile
    a. User will enter the sign-up page from the home or login pages
    b. User completes sign-up form with email and login information entered as data
    c. User will then be directed to the settings page to enter profile information, 
       which is stored in a table in the database 
2. Selecting a driver posted ride as a rider
    a. A driver has the ability to upload a ride at a specified time and date to the mountain of their choosing. 
       We created a table, ride_id, using PostgreSQL in which rides available will be logged. 
    b. The rider will be able to see the list of rides available on their homepage and select a ride.
    c. Once the ride is selected, the ride should be removed from the ride_id table.
3. Looking at a weather report for a specific mountain
    a. A user will be able to search through a list of local mountains and view the temperature and snowfall at 
       various resorts. The data is stored in a table containing the different mountains rides are offered to.
    b. User will go to homepage and use the drop down menu to select a mountain.
    c. The once the mountain is selected, the homepage will display the given temperature based on the data stored 
       in the weather_id table.
